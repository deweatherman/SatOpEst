# "SatOpEst" routines and parts

This repo is similar to RadEst; however SatOpEst is intended as an operational
tool, meaning it interfaces with real observations (e.g. CMSAF Brightness Temp.)


Python based modules, that hopefully if put together will retrieve 
physical variables such as Near Surface Wind Speed, Sea Surface Temperature
etc. by using onboard radiometer observations (i.e. Brightness Temperatures in K)
and apriori data.

## Purpose of the repo

This is a first version of the different modules; there is a lot to be improved in terms of code quality and speed.


## Documentation

Each Jupyter notebook is documented accordingly.


## Acknowledgement

This work was kicked off in the context of a project of EUMETSAT's Ocean and Sea Ice [OSISAF](https://osi-saf.eumetsat.int/) and we highly apprecieate their support.
